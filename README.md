# Functional Programming with Scala - UCSC BSc. Computer Science 2nd Year 1st Semester

This repository contains all the practical code I've done for the Functional Programming module using Scala. The module is part of the BSc. in Computer Science Degree at the University of Colombo School of Computing (UCSC), taken in the 2nd year, 1st semester.

## Structure

The repository is structured by week, with each week's practical work in a separate directory. 

Each directory contains the Scala files for that week.
